# Identifying UART (Day 1)

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

On this date, the following was completed:

- Re-configured my original Raspberry PI Model B+ to act as a UART serial adapter.
    - Verified that it worked by connecting the transmit/receive pins together and typing to view output with the Minicom terminal software.
- Began working to identify the secondary UART connection (starting with the unknown interfaces near the JTAG connector).

## Current Status / Next Steps

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- PROJECT: Continue working to identify the secondary UART connection by checking other pads/pins.

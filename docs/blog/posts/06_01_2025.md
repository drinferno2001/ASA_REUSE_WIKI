# Identifying UART (Day 2)

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

On this date, the following was completed:

- Continued working to identify UART pins by voltage testing smaller pads/pins on board.
    - This was put to a stop as I accidentally fried my older Raspberry PI Model B+ by connecting the pi's UART receive
      pin to a high voltage component on the ASA.
- Ordered new Raspberry PI 5 to use as a replacement UART serial adapter.

---

## Current Status / Next Steps

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- PROJECT: Configure the Raspberry PI 5 as a serial UART adapter once it arrives. 
    - Use it to potentially identify the UART pins/pads that haven't been tested yet.

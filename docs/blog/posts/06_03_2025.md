# Identifying UART (Day 3)

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

On this date, the following was completed:

- Received new power supply for Raspberry PI 5 and configured the device as a serial UART adapter.
- Utilized serial adapter and multimeter to identify UART balls on MCU.
    - This was attempted after re-reading the MCU documentation.
    - We verified that the default console interface could be pulled (to see the normal bootup procedure) but not the secondary interface.

## Current Status / Next Steps

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- DOC WIKI: Finish setting up new documentation (and fix an issue where PDFs or repo-local files couldn't be loaded in the browser).
- PROJECT: Look into other hardware hacking techniques for the device outside of UART/JTAG. (Potentially look into techniques to identify firmware chips and pull directly from them instead.)

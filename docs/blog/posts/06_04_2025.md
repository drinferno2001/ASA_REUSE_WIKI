# Doc Wiki Re-Organization (Hardware, Software, Attempts)

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

On this date, the following was completed:

- Added general memory layout to documentation (pulled from rooted Cisco ASA firmware bootup logs).
- Removed text-based documentation for board pins and organized the data into tables in markdown.
- Broke documentation into separate parent navigation entries for hardware/software.
    - Started doing the same with an **Attempts** section.

## Current Status / Next Steps

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- DOC WIKI: Add/organize other content from the original README file.
- PROJECT: Look into other hardware hacking techniques for the device outside of UART/JTAG.

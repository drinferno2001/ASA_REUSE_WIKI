# Initial WIKI Setup

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

On this date, the following was completed:

- Started setting up github repository for the wiki:
    - Setup general structure (by header contents on original README.md)
    - Copied over all external reference files
        - Started adjusting markdown so that they can be referenced correctly (only fixed generic board documentation).

---

## Current Status / Next Steps:

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- Fixing the weakspots.md file so that any other repo files can be accessed correctly.
